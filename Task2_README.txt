AI & ML Internship - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective
To explore and understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the Titanic dataset using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.

Dataset Used
- cleaned_titanic.csv (generated from Task 1)
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

What I Did
1. Summary Statistics
   - Used .describe() to get an overview of the dataset.
   - Observed distributions, means, medians, standard deviations, etc.

2. Visualizations
   - Histograms for numeric features like Age, Fare.
   - Boxplots to detect outliers and understand spread.
   - Countplots to visualize survival based on Sex and Pclass.
   - Correlation Matrix to check relationships between features.
   - Pairplots for pairwise feature interactions.
   - Checked for skewness in numeric features.

Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)

Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rate.
- Passengers in higher classes (Pclass=1) survived more.
- Age and Fare were slightly skewed and had outliers.
- Fare and Pclass were inversely correlated.

Files Included
- Task2_EDA_Titanic.ipynb: Colab notebook with all EDA steps.
- README.md: Documentation of what was done.

Status
Task Completed and Submitted.
